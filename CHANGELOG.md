# ChangeLogs and Overview Notes:

## TODO:

- [ ] Build our own logger class (that support progress line printing).
- [ ] Create a C binary source (C is a superfast programming language).

### Future Plans:

- [ ] Add support for Windows OS.


## Current State:

- Create a log class and functions (lot of errors on it yet).
- Start C headers and `speedmap.c`

## Note:

- `log.h` and `argpars.h` can be used in any other project, they are a very useful C headers.
